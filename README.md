# CalvinHigdon's **Nvim** Configurations

As one may have guessed by now, this repository's purpose is to keep track of all of my **Nvim** configurations, including all of the plugins that I use with **Nvim**, and their corresponding configuration files.
I will only update this repository when I have completely resolved any issues with any series of changes.

Linux:
Requires clang, neovim, vim, lua

Windows:
Requires CMake, neovim, vim, lua
Top level folder (nvim) should be in ...\Users\<User>\AppData\Local
I downloaded Visual Studio 2022 and then opened the Developer Command Line for Visual Studio 2022, then opened nvim and it automatically solved a weird and annoying "No C Compiler found" error
! This ended up breaking again. instead i had to download a c compiler from a special list

Download neovim using chocolatey. chocolatey.org/install has the info on this


Also install some fonts:

Unpack them and move all of the TrueType/OpenType font files into C:/Windows/fonts
This will make the silly icons work
